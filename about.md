# About Me

I'm a high schooler at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.
Right now, I'm interested in physics, GPU-accelerated computing, and computer graphics.

I'm a self-taught python programmer, and in my free time, I contribute to open source
projects like [Manim](https://manim.community), a python library for animating mathematical concepts.

```{note}
If you're familiar with 3Blue1Brown, this is the same library ([almost](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#why-are-there-different-versions-of-manim))
that he uses to make his videos.
```

I'm also a [Sysadmin at TJHSST](https://sysadmins.tjhsst.edu/) (as part of TJ CSL). As
a Sysadmin, I work on general networking/Linux debugging, as well as web applications like
[Tin](https://github.com/tjcsl/tin) (a code autograder), or [Director4](https://github.com/tjcsl/director4) (a website
hosting platform).

I'm quite new to computer graphics and GPU-accelerated computing as a whole. However,
I have managed to write a [CPU-based raytracer in Rust](https://github.com/JasonGrace2282/raytracing).
