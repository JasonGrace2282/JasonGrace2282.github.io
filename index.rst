Aarush Despande - About Me
==========================

I'm a developer at `Manim Community <https://manim.community>`_, which maintains the popular
open source library `Manim <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim>`_ for creating mathematical animations
in Python. I'm also a Sysadmin at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, where I spend
my time fixing whatever random stuff seems to break :)
